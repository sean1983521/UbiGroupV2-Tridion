                    <p>UBISOFT restricts access to certain Services on age grounds and, in certain jurisdictions, for certain Services and functions, asks for parent approval when underage User under 13 years old (a <b>"Minor"</b>) wishes to register for the Services. When a Minor registers, (s)he must imperatively supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian who will be contacted by UBISOFT to ask him/her to confirm, refuse or modify his/her Minor's registration. UBISOFT reserves the right to limit the period during which a Minor may play pending confirmation and activation by his/her parent or guardian. UBISOFT reserves the right to ask for written proof of parental consent for any User or potential User of the Services we suspect is a Minor. Parental consent applies exclusively to the Service for which it has been granted.</p>
                    <p>In all cases, use of the Services by Minors must take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them.

                    <p>If you agree to test the games and Services, you must sign a confidentiality agreement for each beta test and return it to UBISOFT <i>before</i> you are accredited and the software is supplied to you or made accessible. Your participation in the beta test is subject to your signing of said confidentiality agreement and the following terms. The obligation of confidentiality remains applicable until UBISOFT officially distributes the games, Services and/or Test Contents (as defined below) or discloses them in any other way to the public, without this being attributable to you.</p>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the signed confidentiality agreement, UBISOFT may then provide you with a beta version of a game or games, documentation on the game(s) and/or any other information associated with UBISOFT games, and, if applicable, authorizations to access UBISOFT's websites (collectively known as the <b>"Test Contents"</b>) for the sole purpose of allowing you to test, evaluate and/or comment on the game(s).</p>
                    <p>You must perform the beta test personally and allow no one else to have access to the Test Contents. Beta test accounts may in no case be transferred. You will be asked to inform UBISOFT (and <i>only</i> UBISOFT) of your reactions and suggestions following your experience of the game(s), elements, Content and/or Services in the beta test. All comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, criticisms and other data (collectively referred to as the <b>"Comments"</b>) passed on, disclosed or offered to UBISOFT in the course of the beta tests, or more generally in the course of use of the Services, will be the exclusive property of UBISOFT. You therefore undertake not to exploit or publish your Comments or make them accessible by any means or process to any outside party other than UBISOFT. You acknowledge that, unless prohibited from doing so under the applicable legislation, UBISOFT may use, sell, promote and exploit the Comments in any way, without restriction and without compensation to you.</p>
                    <p>You agree and accept that the Test Contents which are supplied to you are highly confidential and/or exclusive information belonging to UBISOFT. You acknowledge that the beta versions of games and all other Test Contents made available to you by UBISOFT for beta tests have not yet been officially classified and you must make sure that no Test Content can be made available to or accessed by minors.</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge that UBISOFT may protect certain Test Contents by incorporating technical protection measures in them to prevent any unlawful reproduction or modification of the Test Contents. In particular, each Test Content is addressed to you by name and UBISOFT may use digital tattooing ("watermarking) processes to identify any violation of these provisions concerning beta tests.</p>
                    <p>Beta versions of games and more generally any Test Contents are supplied to you "as is" and "according to availability" without any explicit or implicit guarantee of any kind. You play on a beta version at your own risk. You accept that (i) the games may include known or unknown bugs and that (ii) the games may be available only on subscription once the beta phase is completed or at any other time subsequently. You acknowledge that UBISOFT is not obliged to allow you to play free of charge for any period, nor even to authorize you to access these games. You also accept that all your data, particularly any bonuses, points, credits, states of progress and statuses attained in the course of the game may be erased and/or reset at anytime. In this case, your progress and your data will be erased and you will return to beginner status.</p>
                    <p>You agree that violation of your obligations under this Article would cause UBISOFT irreparable damage and that UBISOFT would be entitled to take any action to prevent any breach or risk of a breach of your obligations or to obtain compensation for the damage it has incurred, without prejudice to the right to terminate your Account in accordance with Article 14 below.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the test period, or at any time when UBISOFT asks you to do so, you undertake to return immediately all Test Contents received from UBISOFT.</p>
                    <p>Nothing in these Terms may be interpreted as giving you any right or privilege regarding the Test Contents. All of the Terms apply to the use you make of the games during the beta test phase.</p>

                    <p>To access the Mobile Services from your Compatible Mobile Terminal you must (i) have a Compatible Mobile Terminal, (ii) have the permission of the person who pays the bill for said Compatible Mobile Terminal, (iii) be provided with Internet access via your Compatible Mobile Terminal by your mobile and/or fixed Internet service provider and (iv) be in compliance with the contractual obligations of your mobile and/or fixed Internet service contract. These electronic communication services may use, but are not limited to, "second", "third" or "fourth generation" mobile phone networks, Wi-fi, WiMax, or satellite communications.</p>
                    <p>Mobile Service access costs.</p>
                    <p>The use of a Compatible Mobile Terminal will lead in particular to connection costs. The connection costs may include, for example, the normal rates of your Internet service provider for use of WAP, data transfer or message services indicated in your mobile and/or fixed Internet service contract (included or not in the service package), or any other cost invoiced to the User by his Internet service provider in exchange for electronic communication services. You must contact your Internet service provider for all necessary information concerning the packages available and their prices. UBISOFT is not responsible for any costs you incur from your cell phone or internet services provider as a result of the use of the Services.</p>
                    <p>IF YOU ARE NOT THE PERSON WHO PAYS THE BILL FOR YOUR COMPATIBLE MOBILE TERMINAL, YOU MUST OBTAIN THE PERMISSION OF THE PERSON WHO PAYS THE BILL BEFORE PURCHASING CONTENT ON UBISOFT'S MOBILE SERVICES.</p>
                    <p>Quality of Mobile Services.</p>
                    <p>When the User connects to the Mobile Services, UBISOFT cannot guarantee user comfort equal to that experienced when connecting to the Services via a computer or game console, particularly as regards display quality, response time or access to certain functions such as listening to music or viewing videos. You acknowledge that the user comfort of the Mobile Services depends on the capacities of your Compatible Mobile Terminal and the capacities of the electronic communication network you use, and UBISOFT may in no case be held responsible for reduced user comfort on Mobile Services.</p>
                    <p>Downloading, installing and use of certain Mobile Services supplied via your Compatible Mobile Terminal may be prohibited or restricted by your Internet service provider, and it is possible that the Mobile Services will not all function with all network service providers or devices. You must contact your Internet service provider to find out whether the Mobile Services are available for your device and what restrictions, if any, may apply to the use of said Services for mobile devices.</p>
                    <p>Updating Mobile Telephone Number.</p>
                    <p>In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.</p>

                    <p>If any one of the clauses of the Terms proves to be unnecessary or irrelevant; is deemed null and void or unlawful, and/or for any reason to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction (i) said clause will be interpreted in compliance with the applicable legislation in such a way as to best reflect UBISOFT's initial intentions and (ii) the other clauses of these Terms will remain unchanged and will continue to apply as if the unnecessary, irrelevant, null and void or inapplicable provisions were no longer contained in the Terms.

Waiver of one of the provisions of these Terms may be considered to have taken place only after signing of a written statement to this effect by UBISOFT or by the User.</p>
